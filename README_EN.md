## FAQ

- **Dhizuku not working properly**
  - Developers don't personally use Dhizuku and have limited knowledge about it
  - Dhizuku has permission limitations (can't bypass intent blocks or specify installation source)
  - Tested on SDK ≥34 AVDs
  - Recommended to use Shizuku when possible

- **Lock tool not working**
  - Due to package name changes, use the modified [InstallerX Lock Tool](https://github.com/wxxsfxyzm/InstallerX-Revived/blob/main/InstallerX%E9%94%81%E5%AE%9A%E5%99%A8_1.3.apk)

- **HyperOS shows "System app installation requires valid installer declaration" error**
  - System security restriction
  - Declare a system installer (recommended: `com.android.fileexplorer` or `com.android.vending`)
  - Works with Shizuku/Root (Dhizuku not supported)
  - New feature: Auto-detects HyperOS to add installer in default config

- **HyperOS reverts to default installer**
  - HyperOS revokes permissions if user rejects ADB/Shizuku installation
  - Solution: Manually relock the installer

- **Installation notification freezes on HyperOS**
